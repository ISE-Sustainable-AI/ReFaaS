Okay, I need to translate the given Python code into Go for an AWS Lambda function. Let me break down what the Python code does and how to approach the translation.

First, looking at the Python code, it's a simple Lambda handler that returns a 200 status with "hello world". There are some commented-out sections about fetching an IP address, but those aren't active, so I don't need to include them in the Go version.

The function signature in Python is def lambda_handler(event, context), which takes event and context as parameters. In Go, AWS Lambda handlers use a different structure. The handler function should match the interface func handle(ctx context.Context, event json.RawMessage) (events.APIGatewayProxyResponse, error).

So, I'll start by defining the handler function in Go with that exact signature.

Next, in the Python code, the return is a dictionary with statusCode and body. In Go, this translates to returning an events.APIGatewayProxyResponse struct. The body needs to be a JSON string, so I'll use json.Marshal to convert the message map into a JSON-encoded string.

I should import the necessary packages: "encoding/json", "github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events", and "github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda". Also, include "log" for logging if needed.

Since there's no error handling in the Python code (other than commented parts), I'll assume that the Go function doesn't need to handle any exceptions beyond what's required. But for completeness, I might include a simple return with a 200 status and the message.

Putting it all together, the Go function will create a response map with "message": "hello world", marshal it into JSON, set the statusCode, and return it.

I need to make sure that the function doesn't have any errors. So, I'll check if json.Marshal returns an error, but since it's just a simple struct, it should work without issues. If there is an error, I might log it, but in this case, it's straightforward.

Finally, structure the code correctly, ensuring that the handler function is named appropriately and matches the required interface. Also, include the necessary imports at the top of the file.

I think that covers all the steps. Now, I'll write out the Go code as per these considerations.

```
#### main.go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"log"

	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events"
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
)

func handle(ctx context.Context, event json.RawMessage) (events.APIGatewayProxyResponse, error) {
	response := map[string]string{
		"message": "hello world",
	}

	body, err := json.Marshal(response)
	if err != nil {
		log.Printf("Error marshaling response: %v", err)
		return events.APIGatewayProxyResponse{}, err
	}

	return events.APIGatewayProxyResponse{
		StatusCode: 200,
		Body:       string(body),
	}, nil
}

func main() {
	lambda.Start(handle)
}
```
